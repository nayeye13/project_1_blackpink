                  Roseanne Park MBE (born 11 February 1997), known mononymously as Rosé (Korean: 로제), is a Korean-New
                  Zealand singer and dancer based in South Korea. Born in New Zealand and raised in Australia, Rosé
                  signed with South Korean label YG Entertainment following a successful audition in 2012 and trained
                  for four years before debuting as a member of the South Korean girl group Blackpink in August 2016.
                  <br><br>
                  In March 2021, Rosé made her solo debut with the single album R. The album sold 448,089 copies in its
                  first week, the highest figure by a Korean female soloist. Its lead single "On the Ground" peaked in
                  the top five of South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart and became the highest-charting song by a Korean
                  female soloist on the US Billboard Hot 100, the Canadian Hot 100, and the UK Singles Chart. It was the
                  first song by a Korean solo artist to top the Billboard Global 200, and broke the record for the
                  most-viewed music video in the first 24 hours on YouTube by a Korean solo artist. The album's second
                  single "Gone" peaked in the top ten in South Korea as well.
                  <br><br>
                  Rosé has obtained several accolades throughout her career, including two Guinness World Records, a
                  Hanteo Music Award, and a Mnet Asian Music Award. She is the third-most followed Korean individual on
                  Instagram and appeared on Rolling Stone's list of living icons from Australia and New Zealand. Rosé
                  has been acknowledged for her role in fashion as a global ambassador for Yves Saint Laurent, and
                  became the first female Korean idol to attend the Met Gala in 2021. <br><br><br> <img

               <p class="ri1">Lalisa Manobal (also spelled Manoban; born Pranpriya Manobal; March 27, 1997), known
                  mononymously as Lisa (Korean: 리사), is a Thai rapper, singer and dancer. She is a member of the South
                  Korean girl group Blackpink, which debuted under YG Entertainment in August 2016.
                  <br><br>
                  Lisa made her solo debut with her single album Lalisa in September 2021, which made her the first
                  female artist to sell 736,000 copies of an album in its first week in South Korea. The music video for
                  its lead single of the same name broke the record for the most-viewed music video in the first 24
                  hours on YouTube by a solo artist. Both "Lalisa" and the album's viral second single "Money" charted
                  in the top ten of the Billboard Global 200, the latter becoming the longest-charting song by a female
                  K-pop soloist on the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart. Lalisa and "Money" became the
                  first album and song by a K-pop solo artist to reach one billion streams on Spotify, respectively.
                  <br><br>
                  Lisa earned several accolades throughout her career, including the most Guinness World Records won by
                  a K-pop soloist with eight, a Gaon Chart Music Award, a Mnet Asian Music Award, and the first MTV
                  Video Music Award and MTV Europe Music Award ever won by a K-pop soloist. She is the most-followed
                  K-pop artist on Instagram, as well as the most-subscribed K-pop solo artist on YouTube. Lisa was
                  honored as a cultural ambassador leader by the Thailand Ministry of Culture and has been acknowledged
                  by former Prime Minister of Thailand Prayut Chan-o-cha for her contributions to spreading Thai culture
                  globally. <br><br><br><img src="img/risa/larisa.webp" alt="aa">
